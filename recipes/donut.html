    <h3>This easy donut recipe is made from ingredients you probably already have. My 3-year-old loves these donuts because he can have them whenever he wants since there's hardly any waiting time. Use any topping you want — our favorite is powdered sugar!</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅜ cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons shortening</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir together milk and vinegar; let stand for a few minutes until thick.</li>
        <li>Cream together sugar and shortening in a mixing bowl until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla until well-blended. Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into sugar mixture alternating with milk mixture.</li>
        <li>Roll dough out on a floured surface to 1/3-inch thickness. Cut into donuts using a donut cutter. Let stand for about 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Fry donuts in hot oil in batches until golden, turning over once, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Dust with confectioners' sugar while they are still warm and serve.</li>
    </ol>
